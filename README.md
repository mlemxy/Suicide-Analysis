# Suicide Rates in Singapore: A Data Analysis

This project was conducted to identify the major social determinants contributing to the increasing suicide rates in Singapore and to evaluate how these determinants interact with interventions by the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS). Utilizing a combination of data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and natural language processing (NLP), the study delved into datasets encompassing suicide rates, psychiatric hospital admissions, long-term unemployment, and public sentiment towards SOS interventions.

## Insights
The project revealed significant correlations between suicide rates and various social determinants such as employment status and public health initiatives. Analysis through NLP of public forums highlighted prevalent themes of mental health needs and support within the community, underlining the critical role of accessible mental health services and societal support systems in mitigating suicide risks.

## Process
The analysis embarked on a journey of data collection, cleaning, and integration, employing Python for data manipulation and analysis. A key phase involved exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns within the data, supplemented by NLP techniques to extract and analyze public sentiment towards SOS interventions from online discussions. This multidisciplinary approach enabled a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between social factors and suicide rates in Singapore.

## Challenges
- **Data Sensitivity and Ethics:** Handling sensitive data on suicide required careful consideration of ethical implications, ensuring anonymity and respect for individuals.
- **Interdisciplinary Analysis Complexity:** Integrating insights from various fields such as public health, psychology, and data science presented a complex but enriching challenge.
- **Technical Learning Curve:** The project demanded advanced technical skills in data analysis and natural language processing, necessitating a steep learning curve.
